/*Values Concept
var yearBorn = 1987
/*
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log(yearBorn);

  end every statement in javascript with a semicolon

/*Declaring Variables
* avoid special characters (nothing devoted to other codes)
* use only letters, numbers and/or underscores
* never start with numbers
* names should be relevant
* use "camel case" aka camelCase
 * no spaces within naming variables
* begin with lower case letters (every word after should begin capitalized)
* */

/*Defining Variables
*   giving variables a value
*   declaring variable is making box, defining is storing something inside
*   storage container = value
*   you can declare and define on the same line
*   must declare before you use the variable
*   be careful about spacing and lining up of code, don't break apart keywords and variable names
var age;
age = 25;

var yearOfBirth = 1987;
*/

/*String and Booleans
*   booleans are simplest of values they equal true or false
 *  js needs quotes to know the beginning and end of strings
 *  use quotations to contain the string
 *  use double quotations around strings, this way when quote is
 *      needed machine doesn't get confused.
 *  or use \ befor quotation if you choose to use single quotations
 *  use the code \n to create a line break within phrases
var age = 25;

var isStudent = true;

var firstName = "Jesi";

var phrase = "I don't know";

var phrase = 'I don\'t know \n You\'ll have to with the Professor.'

/*Arrays
    hold collections of values
    you can mix up between variable definitions, values, etc. but generally keep same
    arrays assign index numbers to values - Kermit=0, Miss Piggy=1, etc.
    to set up array index quotation see second line
    index number must be present for

var muppetNames = ["Kermit", "Miss Piggy"];

muppetNames[1] = "Rizzo"
