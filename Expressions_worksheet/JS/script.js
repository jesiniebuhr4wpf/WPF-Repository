    //Calculate the Circumference of a Circle
    //var radius = 6
    //const Pi = 3.14;

    //multiply 2, Pi and the radius & assign to circ variable.

//Problem - Dog Years
//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in
    //human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.

    //Sparky’s age in dog years.
//Result to Print:
    //“Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.

//Problem Answer:

var age = 7;
var dogYears = (age * 2);

console.log("Sparky is" + " " + age + " " + "human years old which is" + " " + dogYears + " " + "in dog years.");
