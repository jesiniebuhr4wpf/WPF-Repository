//Problem - Dog Years
//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in
    //human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”  Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.
//Givens:
    //Sparky’s age.
//Result Varable:
    //Sparky’s age in dog years.
//Result to Print:
    //“Sparky is X human years old which is X in dog years.

//Problem Answer:

//set variables for dog and equivalent dog years
//calculate Sparky's age in dog years.

var age = 7;
var dogYears = (age * 7);

console.log("Sparky is" + " " + age + " " + "human years old which is" + " " + dogYears + " " + "in dog years.");

//Slice of Pie Part 1
    //A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an
        //expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the
        // party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the
        // person dividing the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal,
        // like 3.52 slices, etc.)

    //Given:
        //Number of slices per pizza
        //Number of people at the party
        //Number of pizzas ordered.

    //Result Variables:
        //Number of slices per person. (Can be a decimal or floating point).

    //Result to Print:
        //“Each person ate X slices of pizza at the party.”

//Calculate how much pizza each partygoer will get (assume all pizzas have same
    //number of slices (the result can be a decimal).
//possible expression for number of slices each person ate - sliPerPie * pizzas/people
var sliPerPie = 8;
var people = 13;
var pizzas = 4;
